==============================
Simple Seo Backend for Django
==============================

Simple cache backend for Django. Inspired by django-seo ( https://github.com/willhardy/django-seo ) but found it quite
complex for the simple functionality it was intended for.

Only implements view based backend. Maybe in future releases it will include Model backend.


==============================
Version 0.2
